  <Abstract>Our shipboard data systems have been using UDP/IP broadcast datagrams for distributing real-time underway data starting on the R/V &lt;i&gt;Conrad&lt;/i&gt; in 1987 and expanding to include the &lt;i&gt;Ewing&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Palmer&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gould&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Healy&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Langseth&lt;/i&gt; among others. This approach has many advantages including: ease of implementation; simplicity; and isolation of the clients from the real-time loggers. A number of other shipboard data systems have successfully adopted this approach. In the modern era of nearly full-time Internet connectivity for the research fleet, the ability to distribute near-real-time data to shore sites is expanding rapidly and should be done efficiently. For example, the NSF-supported Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R) and Shipboard Automated Meteorological and Oceanographic System (SAMOS) projects are jointly developing a new protocol to transfer high-frequency meteorological and surface oceanographic data from fleet vessels to a shore server for monitoring and quality control. At the same time, we are finding more sophisticated uses for real-time data at sea in addition to our own need to automate on-board real-time data quality checking. In order to facilitate these needs, we are developing a plan to migrate our data system to Multicast datagrams and add an open, standards-based discovery service so that clients connecting to our shipboard network can automatically find and use our data streams. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;</Abstract>
