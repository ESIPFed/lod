  <Abstract>The use of fossils to constrain age models for geological samples is not as straightforward as it might seem. Even though index fossils have been defined as biostratigraphic time markers ambiguity arises from the synonymous use of taxonomic names.  Progress in our understanding of the origin of certain species have sometimes lead to substantial changes in the taxonomic classification of these organisms. TaxonConcept was created as part of the Stratigraphy.net initiative as a tool to manage taxonomic information and complex knowledge networks to help resolve taxonomic ambiguities in biostratigraphy. Its workflow is based on the principles of open nomenclature. Open nomenclature allows researchers to comment on the identification of a specimen which cannot exactly be determined and is frequently used in synonymy lists. The use of such synonymy lists in TaxonConcept allows to work with taxonomic classifications that are uncertain, or where several versions exist. Every single taxonomic entity in TaxonConcept is recorded with its relevant citations in the literature. This allows to manage information on taxonomy. The members of working groups using TaxonConcept can record their opinion on the taxonomic classification of each taxon in the framework of open nomenclature and annotate it in free text. This managed and structured collection of taxonomic opinions is an example of knowledge management. Taxonomic opinions are otherwise dispersed throughout  the literature, if recorded at all, and are only available to the specialist. Assembled as a collection, they represent our knowledge on the taxonomy of a certain group of organisms. In the terminology of computer science, the semantic relationships between taxonomic terms are an ontology. Open nomenclature  offers a formal framework that lends itself very well to describe the nature of the relations between taxonomic terms. The use of such synonymy lists in a taxonomic information system allows interesting search options, ranging from tracking name changes to the investigation of complex taxonomic topologies. In addition to its synonymy and literature management, TaxonConcept allows to store many other information categories such as textual descriptions (e.g. diagnoses and comments), images, bioevents and specimen and collection data. Ecological information is scheduled for a later stage of the project. Already now TaxonConcept is linked to taxon names in paleoenvironmental data of the World Data Center for Marine Environmental Sciences (WDC-MARE), interfaces to other databases are planned. WDC-MARE stores environmental, marine and geological research data and frequently uses taxon names in its parameters. By linking TaxonConcept and WDC-MARE, synonymous names can be included in queries, e.g. when researching for stable isotope data measured on microfossils. TaxonConcept is not a project on authoritative taxonomic information, but is a tool for taxonomic projects to use to find a taxonomic consensus, e.g. to define a taxonomic framework for biostratigraphic studies. Both, the project specific hierarchical classification of selected taxa, as well as a project specific selection of any other information categories is supported by TaxonConcept. The results of such a taxonomic consensus can be used to create &lt;em&gt; Fossilium Catalogus&lt;/em&gt; style summaries in various output formats which can later be used to create online or print publications.</Abstract>
