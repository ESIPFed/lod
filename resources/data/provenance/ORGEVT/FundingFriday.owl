                    >FUNding Friday is an annual mini-competition established by the Earth Science Information Partnership (ESIP) in 2008 at the 
                    Summer Meeting in Durham, NH. Several $5,000 awards are given to members to fund small projects that are inspired by ESIP 
                    collaboration or participation. In 2009, the ESIP Federation created a student competition with awards of $3,000.
                    
                    This competition serves several purposes:
                    
                    * promotes and rewards new collaborations or bridges between ESIP projects and technologies, so that novel outcomes can be explored.
                    * fosters small-scale projects of real value by supporting programmer salary, travelâ€”whatever is needed to realize the proposed work.
                    * showcases how the ESIP Federation can leverage current technologies and member skills to add new services with a modest amount of 
                    effort(and funding).
                    * rewards members who are looking to explore new collaborations and new ideas inspired by other Federation member activities.
